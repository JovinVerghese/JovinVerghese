I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science and have a stong passion for technology, especially in the field of Cyber Security.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join as an Offensive Security Professional.

## Skills

Currently doing the Linux Fundamentals Module in Hack The Box and participating in several Capture The Flag platforms. Since my project at college was a web based task management system, I have some experience in web development and Python. Still working hard to increase my knowledge in the fields I am most interested in and especially in the field of Cyber Security.
