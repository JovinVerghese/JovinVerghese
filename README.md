I am a recent degree graduate with a profound interest in computer science and a dedication to thrive in the field of Cyber Security.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join as an Offensive Security Professional.

## Skills

Currently doing the Linux Fundamentals Module in Hact The Box and participating in serverel Capture The Flag platforms. Since my project at college was a web based task management system, I have some experience in web development, have experience in Python. Still working hard to increase my knowledge in the fields I am most interested in and especially in the field of Cyber Security.
